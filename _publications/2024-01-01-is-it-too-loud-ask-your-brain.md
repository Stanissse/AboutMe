Purpose: In this study, the objectification of the subjective perception of loudness was investigated using electroencephalography (EEG). In particular, the emergence of objective markers in the domain of the acoustic discomfort threshold was examined.

Methods: A cohort of 27 adults with normal hearing, aged between 18 and 30, participated in the study. The participants were presented with 500 ms long noise stimuli via in-ear headphones. The acoustic signals were presented with sound levels of [55, 65, 75, 85, 95 dB]. After each stimulus, the subjects provided their subjective assessment of the perceived loudness using a colored scale on a touchscreen. EEG signals were recorded, and afterward, event-related potentials (ERPs) locked to sound onset were analyzed.

Results: Our findings reveal a linear dependency between the N100 component and both the sound level and the subjective loudness categorization of the sound. Additionally, the data demonstrated a nonlinear relationship between the P300 potential and the sound level as well as for the subjective loudness rating. The P300 potential was elicited exclusively when the stimuli had been subjectively rated as "very loud" or "too loud".

Conclusion: The findings of the present study suggest the possibility of the identification of the subjective uncomfortable loudness level by objective neural parameters.
