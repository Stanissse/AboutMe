Keynote lecture with Prof. Schmutzhard on surgical and audiological aspects of cochlear implantation in patients with inner ear malformations.

Hearing rehabilitation in patients with inner ear malformations (IEMs) requires individualized approaches, particularly when fitting cochlear implants (CIs). This presentation highlights six clinical cases representing a spectrum of IEMs: two IP-I, one IP-II (Mondini), one IP-III, one Large Vestibular Aqueduct Syndrome (LVAS), one Michel malformation, and one case of cochlear nerve hypoplasia. CI fitting in IP-II and IP-III shows variable outcomes, with IP-III often complicated by poor neural integrity despite full electrode insertion. Patients with IP-I, while surgically challenging, can benefit from auditory input depending on neural availability. LVAS and cochlear nerve hypoplasia cases are currently managed with hearing aids, often yielding satisfactory speech perception. The Michel case remains non-implantable. Challenges in mapping and speech processor optimization are discussed, emphasizing the importance of anatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral data integration for best outcomes. The session offers practical insights across this diverse group of patients.
