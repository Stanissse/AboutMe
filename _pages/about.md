<br><br>
Hey, I‚Äôm **Dr. Philipp Zelger**, a researcher in auditory neuroscience and clinical audiology at **Medical University of Innsbruck Austria**. My work focuses on understanding and improving hearing rehabilitation through brain-based diagnostics, pupillometry, and auditory implants.

My research integrates **neurophysiology**, **audiology**, and **speech sciences**, with an emphasis on:
- Understanding of loudness perception
- Directional hearing in children and adults
- Brainstem and cortical auditory evoked potentials (EEG, BERA)
- Tinnitus and hearing loss mechanisms
- Cochlear implant rehabilitation
- fNIRS, EEG, and multimodal neuroimaging
- Acoustic and voice analysis in clinical populations

### üî¨ Current Research Focus

My current research centers on **loudness perception** using pupillometry, the understanding of **directional hearing in children** with and without hearing aids, and the use of **intraoperative measures** during cochlear implantation to **optimize audiological outcomes**.
