Welcome! I’m **Dr. Philipp Zelger**, a researcher in auditory neuroscience and clinical audiology at **Medical University of Innsbruck Austria**. My work focuses on understanding and improving hearing through brain-based diagnostics and auditory prosthetics such as cochlear implants.

My research integrates **neurophysiology**, **audiology**, and **speech sciences**, with an emphasis on:
- Brainstem and cortical auditory evoked potentials (EEG, BERA)
- Tinnitus and hearing loss mechanisms
- Cochlear implant rehabilitation
- fNIRS and multimodal neuroimaging
- Acoustic and voice analysis in clinical populations

### 🔬 Current Research

I’m currently leading a project using **fNIRS** and **electrode-specific stimulation** to investigate **cortical responses to cochlear implant tonotopy**. I also analyze raw BERA data and develop novel processing pipelines for clinical EEG.
